# Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This document is for me to learn something new in a different way.

I am thinking about using Vite, TypeScript and pnpm as the package manager to refactor this code.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

- `lint errors`

- What does lint errors mean?

- A lint error is a programming error, bug, or stylistic issue flagged by a lint tool. 

- A lint tool is a static code analyzer that scans source code for issues.

- The term "lint" in programming comes from an old tool called lint, which was originally developed in 1978 for the C programming language to analyze source code for errors. The name comes from "lint" (fuzz or tiny fibers) that accumulate in clothes—just like small mistakes or inconsistencies can accumulate in code.

### `npm test`

> Launches the `test runner` in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

What is the test runner?

- Test Runner is a tool that is used to run or execute tests and export results. 
- It is a library that selects the source code directory and picks the test files to run them for verifying bugs and errors.

- Jest is a Node-based runner.
- The tests run in a Node environment, not in a real browser.
- It enable fast iteration speed. (Need example)
- It prevent flakiness. (Why?)
- flaky test: Giving same testing program, testing environment and testing code, the test cases that sometimes passed, and sometimes failed.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
